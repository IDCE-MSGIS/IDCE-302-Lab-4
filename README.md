# IDCE-302-Lab-4

Python 3.4

This repo includes three scripts to accomplish the following:
1) a function to capitalize the "M" and "D" in MacDonald
2) a script to edit text scraped from the National Weather Service website to read more cleanly
3) a script to pull and print latitude and longitude from a google maps URL

Notes: The script for adding spaces in script 2 is long (though functional) and could certainly be cleaned up to read more cleanly.
